GitHub did not want to upload the assets folder as it was complaining about the file size being too big. I zipped the file and it was only 
6MB which is way under the 25MB limit. The assets folder would need to be unzipped and placed in the root. Project was created using VS Code, you can download the entire project as ZIP and extract on Desktop. Create local PHP server and view the project.

I also excluded all the music as that is over 600MB
